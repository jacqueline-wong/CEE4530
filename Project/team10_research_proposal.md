# Research Proposal for CEE 4530

### Team 10: Victor Khong & Jacqueline Wong ###

Write your research proposal in Atom. You can begin defining variables and calculating parameters as you design your proposed research. This research proposal can then evolve into your final report.

#### Introduction ####

Activated carbon is useful in adsorbing... However it is relatively expensive and is not used in AguaClara treatment plants. Interested

- Intro/context – What is the problem? Why is it important?

Our team is interested in investigating methods to optimize the effectiveness of an adsorption system, in particular how the variation in the way the adsorbent is placed within the column and a change in influent flow rate into the adsorption system affects the effectiveness of the adsorption system in removing a pollutant from the water. This is an interesting problem that has practical applications because our society is constantly faced with the challenge to treat wastewater at a low cost and at an efficient manner. The results of this experiment will enable scientists and engineers to gain a better understanding towards building the most optimal adsorption system, which is used in most wastewater treatment plant.


#### Objectives ###

Our hypothesis


- Objectives – What is the hypothesis? What will you do to test the hypothesis?

#### Experimental plan ####

#### Part 1 ####

Mixed, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 layers

The hypothesis for the experiment is

- Experimental plan including – How will you measure it?

In this experiment, the effectiveness of the adsorption system will be measured in accordance to how clear the water filtered out is and the duration at which the absorbent is able to last.

- Key design parameters
    - flow rates
    - volumes
    - concentrations
    - range of parameters that you are varying etc.

- Timeline of tasks/experiments

50% by mass


We

- Possible hurdles/challenges

There is a possibility that our experiment will not yield any meaningful results. Hence, we have prepared back-up ideas to alter our experiment. There is also difficulty in ensuring the quality of absorbent used will be exactly the same. Hence, the experiment will be repeated multiple times to ensure that the result collected is accurate.

- Refs to primary, review, and other literature and possibly to previous years’ projects



- Resources needed to conduct experiments – What tools will you use?

For simplicity, this experiment will utilize a basic adsorption system. The adsorption system will be built using a peristaltic pump, an adsorption column, #17 tubing, and a photometer. The absorbent of the system is activated carbon. The rest of the adsorption column will be filled with sand. There should be equal mass of activated carbon and sand in the adsorption column. The adsorption system will be set up as shown in Figure 1.
