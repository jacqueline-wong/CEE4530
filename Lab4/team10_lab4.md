### Discussion ###

1. Under what condition does ProCoDA switch from the “prepare to calibrate” state to the “calibrate” state?

ProCoDA switches from the "prepare to calibrate" state to the "calibrate" state when the accumulator pressure is greater than the minimum calibration pressure given the data average interval of 0.1 s.

2. Under what condition does ProCoDA switch from the “calibrate” state to the “Pause” state?

ProCoDA switches from the "calibrate" state to the "Pause" state when the accumulator pressure is greater than the maximum calibration pressure given the data average interval of 0.1 s.

3. How does the “Pause” state know which state to go to next?

ProCoDA switches from the "Pause" state to the next state "Aerate" because of the "New Rule" in ProCoDA, when elapsed time in the current state is greater than the elapsed time to calibrate to aeration lag.

4. What is the equation that is used to calculate the maximum calibration pressure and why is this equation better than using a constant for the maximum calibration pressure?

The equation used to calculate the maximum calibration pressure is:

$$\frac{\text{max cal}}{\text{source}} \times \text{source pressure}$$

This is better than using a constant for the maximum calibration pressure as the source pressure may change.

5. Explain how ProCoDA calculates the predicted pressure in the accumulator when it is filled at a constant mass flow rate.

ProCoDA calculates predicted pressure in the accumulator using the air flow model. Its inputs are minimum calibration pressure, maximum calibration pressure and fill time. Using the ramp function, it goes from minimum pressure to maximum pressure over the fill time linearly.

$$\frac{\text{max cal pressure}-\text{min cal pressure}}{\text{fill time}}$$

6. What are the inputs to the “air valve control”?

The inputs to the "air valve control" are air slope, air flow rate, accumulator pressure and source pressure.

7. What does “air valve control” control and which two states use it?

"Air valve control" controls the solenoid valves. The two states that use it are "Aerate" and "Fill accumulator".

8. Write a ProCoDA program that cycles between two states that aerate for 15 s and then pause for 10 s. Show the TA!
