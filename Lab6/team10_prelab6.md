<b> 1. A carbon column is packed with 15 cm of activated carbon and then used to remove 50 mg/L of red dye #40. The approach velocity is 1 mm/s, the porosity is 0.4, and the bulk density of the activated carbon is 0.5 g/cm3. How long will it take for the mass transfer zone to travel to the bottom of the carbon column? </b>
